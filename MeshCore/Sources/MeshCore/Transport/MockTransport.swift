/// Provides a simulated transport for testing and local development.
///
/// `MockTransport` allows developers to test MeshCore functionality without requiring
/// physical hardware or Bluetooth availability. It maintains a history of sent data
/// and provides methods to inject simulated responses from the device.
///
/// ## Testing Strategy
///
/// Use `MockTransport` in unit tests to verify that commands are correctly formatted and
/// sent by the session, and that the session correctly handles various device responses.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let mock = MockTransport()
/// let session = MeshCoreSession(transport: mock)
/// try await session.start()
///
/// // Simulate a device response
/// await mock.simulateOK()
///
/// // Verify what was sent
/// let sent = await mock.sentData
/// XCTAssertFalse(sent.isEmpty)
/// ```
