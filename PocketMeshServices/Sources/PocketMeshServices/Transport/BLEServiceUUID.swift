/// ## Naming Convention
/// TX/RX are named from the **central's perspective** (this app):
/// - TX = we transmit (write) to the peripheral
/// - RX = we receive (notifications) from the peripheral
///
/// This is inverted from the Nordic UART Service standard naming, which uses
/// the peripheral's perspective. The actual UUIDs are correct.
