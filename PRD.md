# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for PocketMesh

## 1. Document Overview
### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD documents the requirements and implementation of PocketMesh, a native iOS application that enables seamless messaging and configuration over MeshCore BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices. The app leverages the publicly documented Companion Radio Protocol to connect users to MeshCore companion radios and remote repeaters, facilitating off-grid, mesh-based communication. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly experience for casual end users, making it as simple as possible to start messaging, similar to popular apps like iMessage and Signal.

**Implementation Status**: PocketMesh is a **planned iOS application** that will include MapKit integration for contact locations, BLE connection management with state restoration, and an iMessage-style chat interface. All core features and implementation phases described in this document are planned for implementation.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**: Core messaging (text and emojis in direct messages and channels), MeshCore device configuration for companion radios and remote repeaters, onboarding, notifications, location integration, on-device data storage.
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced features like trace paths or custom variables (planned for future iterations), monetization, third-party cloud syncing (except potential future iCloud for keys), multi-language support beyond English/US, encryption (MeshCore BLE device firmware handles encryption)
- **Future Enhancements**: iPad/macOS optimization (app is universal from launch), additional protocol commands, iCloud key backups, internationalization.

### 1.3 Version History
- Version 1.0: Initial PRD drafted on December 5, 2025.

### 1.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have access to MeshCore BLE companion radios and repeaters.
- The Companion Radio firmware (@MeshCore-firmware-example) is the source of truth; no customizations or enhancements to the MeshCore protocol.
- Development relies on Apple's frameworks (e.g., SwiftUI, CoreBluetooth, SwiftData, MapKit, UserNotifications, CoreLocation).
- No third-party libraries; free and open-source only if absolutely necessary (but avoided per requirements).
- Hardware testing via physical devices and Xcode debugging.
- App assumes good-faith use; no enforcement of disallowed activities per safety guidelines.

## 2. Target Audience and User Personas
### 2.1 Target Audience
- Casual end users interested in off-grid messaging, such as emergency preppers, or communities in remote areas.
- Age: 18+, tech-savvy but not developers; familiar with apps like iMessage or Signal.
- Platform: iPhone users on iOS 18.0+; optimized for iOS 26.2; universal app for iPhone/iPad/macOS via Catalyst.
- Region: Primarily US/English, with design for easy future localization.

### 2.2 User Personas
- **Casual Messenger (Primary)**: Alex, 28, Search and Rescue personnel. Wants to create a MeshCore network at SAR sites to enable off-grid communication between him and his team.
- Pain Points: No "KISS" apps.
- **Tech Tinkerer (Secondary)**: Jordan, 35, hobbyist. Enjoys configuring repeaters for extended range but appreciates a clean UI to avoid complexity.
- Pain Points: Complicated setups in existing tools; lack of intuitive messaging interfaces for MeshCore.

## 3. Product Features
Features are prioritized: MVP focuses on messaging and basic config; extensible for advanced additions.

### 3.1 Onboarding and Setup
- Simple, guided flow explaining MeshCore basics, BLE connection, contact discovery via adverts, and default radio params (US-focused).
- Permissions prompts: BLE, notifications, location.
- PIN entry for device pairing (default 123456 or random for screen-equipped devices).
- User can set public info (name, public key retrieval, location toggle).

### 3.2 Messaging
- **Direct Messaging**: Text/emojis to contacts (max 160 bytes); history, delivery tracking via ACK codes, replies (long-press to reply, no threading). Retry logic: 3 direct attempts with exponential backoff, then flood mode fallback.
- **Channels**: Support up to 8 slots (0 public, 1-7 custom). Create by entering slot index, name, and 16-byte secret (explicitly configured); join via shared name/secret; leave by clearing slot. Broadcast messages (no ACKs for channels); no discovery/limits/admin features.
- **UI**: iMessage-like chat bubbles, timestamps, status indicators (queued, sending, sent, acknowledged, failed). Input field with send button.
- **Offline Handling**: Up to 10 message queuing; user-visible indicators; long-press to delete queued messages. MeshCore BLE firmware will use push notifications to notify the app of incoming messages (no app polling). Auto-message fetching when notifications received via MeshCore firmware push notification.
- No attachments or binary data.

### 3.3 Contact Management
- **Discovery**: Manual advert send (Zero Hop for nearby, Flood for network-wide); auto-scan and add incoming adverts (toggle for confirmation). Advertisements contain public key (32 bytes), name, location (optional), and path information. Path discovery with multi-hop routing and trace routing.
- **Sync**: Contact synchronization with timestamp watermarking to reduce payload on repeated syncs (only fetch contacts modified since last sync).
- **List**: Searchable, editable (delete); store name, public key (32 bytes), contact type (CHAT/REPEATER/ROOM), location (if shared), path length/data, last advertisement timestamp.
- Public keys retrieved from device/protocol; no app-generated keys.

### 3.4 Device Configuration
- **Companion Radio**:
  - Radio params: Frequency, Bandwidth, Spreading Factor, Coding Rate, Transmit Power (pickers/sliders).
  - Public info: Name, public key, location (toggle sharing in adverts).
- **Remote Repeater**:
  - Telemetry: Battery, stats (RSS, SNR, Noise Floor, Packets Sent/Received).
  - Edit: Name, position (via map pin), public key copy, radio params, auto-clock set from iPhone.
  - Controls: Advert settings/send, guest/admin passwords, reboot. Access Control List (ACL) permission management for repeaters.
- UI: Dedicated settings tab; changes sent via protocol commands.

### 3.8 Firmware-Specific Capabilities
- **Telemetry Modes**: Base, location, and environmental telemetry configuration
- **Custom Variables**: Key-value storage and retrieval on devices
- **Trace Packets**: Route testing and SNR mapping
- **Binary Protocol**: Extended binary commands for device interaction

### 3.5 Integrations

   - **User Interaction Handling**: Background data loading with foreground interaction detection
   - **Auto-Centering**: Automatic map centering on contact locations with viewport management
   - **Performance**: Optimized annotation updates, loading states, and coordinate handling. Attribute-based event filtering for subscriptions.
   - **Location Privacy**: Opt-in only; explicit permission request. Location sharing toggle in settings.

### 3.6 Settings and Data Management
- **Toggles**: Auto-add contacts, notification types (message notifications, low battery warnings).
- **Data Storage**: On-device only via SwiftData; no cloud sync. Per-device database isolation using public key as identifier.
- **SwiftData Models**:
  - `Device`: Public key (unique), name, firmware version, radio parameters, location, relationships to contacts/messages/channels
  - `Contact`: Public key (unique), name, type (CHAT/REPEATER/ROOM), location, path info, last advertisement timestamp
  - `Message`: ID, text (max 160 bytes), timestamps, delivery status, ACK code, retry tracking, SNR/path metadata, relationships to device/contact/channel
  - `Channel`: Slot index (0-7), name, secret (16 bytes for non-public), creation/last message dates
- **Error Handling**: In-app alerts for protocol errors with specific error codes and recovery strategies, connection failures, low battery warnings. Connection auto-reconnect with exponential backoff and configurable limits.

### 3.7 UI/UX Guidelines
- **Overall Design**: Signal-inspired clean, privacy-focused design with iOS-native elements (e.g., Liquid Glass for translucent UI effects).
- **Messaging Interface**:
  - iMessage-style bubbles with different colors for sent (blue) vs. received (gray)
  - Real-time delivery status text under messages (like iMessage)
  - Message timestamps and metadata (SNR for received messages, RTT for acknowledged) available in a long-press "Details" menu
  - Reply indicator UI (long-press to bring up context menu, tap reply. Replies show quoted text)
  - Context menu for actions (reply, details, delete queued messages)
- **Navigation**: TabView with 4 tabs (Chats, Contacts, Map, Settings) - Map tab provides contact discovery and location visualization
- **Adaptive Layout**: Universal app for iPhone/iPad/macOS (use size classes for layouts)
- **Accessibility**: Standard iOS support (VoiceOver, dynamic type, sufficient contrast ratios)
- **Notifications**: Banner-style with quick reply action, visible even in foreground
